# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-orietnted design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
For our Finch Robot we chose to make it go throughout the maze that consisted of about 7 turns from start to finish. This maze seemed the most engaging and coolest. So, we programmed a sequence of precise turns and movements to get from start to finish. As well, including object-oriented programming principals by changing up and organizing our code into methods for different movement patterns.

## Challenges faced and solutions
One of the biggest challenges we faced was having to constantly run back and forth between the computer and maze to test if the code was working as instructed. The Finch robot kept disconnecting and us having to reconnect is very often slowed down our progress even more. The solution we came u with was to break our code down into smaller parts and testing each part seperately, this saved us a bunch of time and let us know what was needed and what was done. Another problem we faced was that the robot kept hitting the cardboard walls and measurements/speed being wrong. To figure this out we took a ruler and wrote down all the correct measurements on an index card ensuring the right measurements and we slowed down the speed of the motors and slowly increased it when we felt like we have got the correct amount right. Lastly, the set-up part of the Finch robot rocess was really confusing! We got lost and were a little behind. For a quick and informative solution we called our teacher, Mr. Aiello in which he helped us get set up.

## Future enhancements
Since time wasn't really on our side we couldn't risk having any major problems or much coding errors, we decided to keep it simple but yet very effective. Furthermore, if we were to do any future enhancements we would have added wall censors to our Finch Robot, which would show the advancement of it and the robot going smoothly throughout the maze. As well, instead of just staying with the maze we could perhaps switch to a different role such as making the robot draw something cool.
